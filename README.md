# demo-website

I have designed and developed the frontend of above mentioned website and integrated it with its backend. It is a demo website which is made completely using HTML5 and CSS3.The backend programming is done using php and mysql. It is a responsive website, ie it adjusts its width according to size of the screen. It is about bitcoin highlighting its productivity and quenching the lack of knowledge about bitcoin amongst masses.
